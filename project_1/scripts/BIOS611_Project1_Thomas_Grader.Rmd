# Introduction

![](http://www.umdurham.org/assets/images/logo-new1.png)

The [Urban Ministries of Durham](http://www.umdurham.org/) (UMD) fights poverty and homeless by offering food, shelter, and a future to neighbors in need. Their mission is accomplished through three primary programs: a [community shelter](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/shelter.html) to house homeless neighbors, a [community cafe](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/cafe.html) that provides hot and cold meals three times a day, and a [food pantry and clothing closet](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/food-pantry.html).

During the 2017-2018 [fiscal year](http://umdurham.org/assets/files/UMD_2018AnnualReport_Online.pdf), UMD provided 54,378 nights of shelter to homeless neighbors (792 unique individuals), served 248,028 meals through the community cafe, and provided clothing and groceries to over 500 households per month. Importantly, they ended homelessness for 243 individuals.

In collaboration with [Biostatistics 611](https://biodatascience.github.io/datasci611/), a course titled "Introduction to Data Science" at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UMD released a dataset of services provided. 

# Study Aim

The purpose of this project is address how UMD's core services have changed over time. We will focus on the food pantry and clothing closet services.

Specifically, our aim is to quantify changes in the distribution of food, clothing, school kits, hygiene kits, and diapers (2010-2017). We focus on more recent years since they may be more indicative of outcomes in the near future.

A sub-aim of this project is to understand the quality of the data available to UMD.

This document is presented for data analysts to understand how the analysis was completed.

# Data Processing

```{r intro, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read in packages and data
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/bios611-projects-fall-2019-alvinthomas/project_1")

proj1 <- read_tsv("../../datasci611/data/project1_2019/UMD_Services_Provided_20190719.tsv")
proj1_meta <- read_tsv("../../datasci611/data/project1_2019/UMD_Services_Provided_metadata_20190719.tsv")

```

Here is a brief peek of the data provided by UMD.

```{r summary, echo=TRUE}
head(proj1)
```

There are several variables that do not provide data that can be used in this analysis. The variables `field1`, `field2`, and `field3` are missing for almost everyone in the dataset. The variable `clientfilemerge` is not necessary for our analysis as is `Bus Tickets (Number of)`, `Notes of Service`, `Food Provided for`, `Referrals`, `Financial Support`, `Type of Bill Paid`, and `Payer of Support`.

```{r remove_vars, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Remove extra variables
proj1 <- proj1 %>%
  select(-starts_with("field")) %>%
  select(-matches("clientfilemerge")) %>%
  select(-one_of("Bus Tickets (Number of)","Notes of Service",
                 "Food Provided for", "Referrals", "Financial Support",
                 "Type of Bill Paid", "Payer of Support"))
```

The date variables was read in as a character vectors. We can use `lubridate` to make it date-readable. We can also plot our new variable.

```{r date, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
proj1 <- proj1 %>%
  mutate(date_new=mdy(proj1$Date))

ggplot(data=proj1, aes(x=date_new)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Date of Service") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Full Range of Available Dates")
```

There is probably an error with one of the dates - the entire dataset should be in the more recent era. Plus, there are some dates in the future.

We will restrict analyses to the period starting in January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2017. 

```{r date_restrict, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
proj1 <- proj1 %>%
  filter(between(date_new, as.Date("2010-01-01"), as.Date("2017-12-31"))) %>%
  arrange(date_new)

ggplot(data=proj1, aes(x=date_new)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Date of Service") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Restricted Range of Available Dates (2010-2017)")
```

We are specifically interested in food (in lbs), items of clothing, school kits, hygiene kits, and diapers. We also want to clean up any extreme values.

Let's handle extreme values first. We will set values greater than 3 standard deviations to NA.

```{r handle_large, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remove extreme outliers

# Food
sum(is.na(proj1$`Food Pounds`))
outlier <- boxplot.stats(proj1$`Food Pounds`, coef = 3)$out
proj1$`Food Pounds` <- 
  ifelse(proj1$`Food Pounds` %in% outlier, NA, proj1$`Food Pounds`)
sum(is.na(proj1$`Food Pounds`))

# Clothing
sum(is.na(proj1$`Clothing Items`))
outlier <- boxplot.stats(proj1$`Clothing Items`, coef = 3)$out
proj1$`Clothing Items` <- 
  ifelse(proj1$`Clothing Items` %in% outlier, NA, proj1$`Clothing Items`)
sum(is.na(proj1$`Clothing Items`))

# School Kits
sum(is.na(proj1$`School Kits`))
outlier <- boxplot.stats(proj1$`School Kits`, coef = 3)$out
proj1$`School Kits` <- 
  ifelse(proj1$`School Kits` %in% outlier, NA, proj1$`School Kits`)
sum(is.na(proj1$`School Kits` ))

# Hygiene Kits
sum(is.na(proj1$`Hygiene Kits`))
outlier <- boxplot.stats(proj1$`Hygiene Kits`, coef = 3)$out
proj1$`Hygiene Kits` <- 
  ifelse(proj1$`Hygiene Kits` %in% outlier, NA, proj1$`Hygiene Kits`)
sum(is.na(proj1$`Hygiene Kits`))

# Diapers
sum(is.na(proj1$Diapers))
outlier <- boxplot.stats(proj1$Diapers, coef = 3)$out
proj1$Diapers<- 
  ifelse(proj1$Diapers %in% outlier, NA, proj1$Diapers)
sum(is.na(proj1$Diapers))

```

Now we can prepare the data for graphing.

```{r sum_dates, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Summarize data by client
proj1_clients <- proj1 %>%
  group_by(`Client File Number`) %>%
  arrange(`Client File Number`) %>%
  mutate(services=n()) %>%
  summarise(total=max(services),
            date_started=min(date_new),
            date_last=max(date_new)) %>%
  mutate(year_started=year(date_started),
         year_ended=year(date_last)) %>%
  mutate(time_served=date_last-date_started)

# Total visits per client
proj1_clients_year <- proj1 %>%
  mutate(year = year(date_new)) %>%
  arrange(`Client File Number`, date_new) %>%
  group_by(`Client File Number`, year) %>%
  mutate(services=n()) %>%
  summarise(total=max(services))

# Summarize data by month and year
proj1_date <- proj1 %>%
  mutate(year = year(date_new), month = month(date_new)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  replace_na(list(`Food Pounds` = 0, 
             `Clothing Items` = 0, 
             `School Kits` = 0,
             `Hygiene Kits` = 0,
             Diapers = 0)) %>%
  mutate(food_cumsum = cumsum(`Food Pounds`),
        cloth_cumsum = cumsum(`Clothing Items`),
        school_cumsum = cumsum(`School Kits`),
        hygiene_cumsum = cumsum(`Hygiene Kits`),
        diaper_cumsum = cumsum(Diapers)) %>%
  summarise(food_total=max(food_cumsum, na.rm = TRUE),
            cloth_total=max(cloth_cumsum, na.rm = TRUE),
            school_total=max(school_cumsum, na.rm = TRUE),
            hygiene_total=max(hygiene_cumsum, na.rm = TRUE),
            diaper_total=max(diaper_cumsum, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Let's peek. These are the types of graphs we would like to make.

```{r plot_lbs_test, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Example graph
proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=food_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="Food\nDistributed (lbs)", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Food Distributed (lbs)")
```

# Results

We were interested in the change in services at UMD over time. In order to visualize these trends, I created heatmaps (using `geom_raster`). 

## Distribution of Services per Client

We want to have an idea of how many services encounters each neighbor has with UMD. The median was 13 encounters (IQR: 5, 29). 

```{r plot_clients, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
proj1_clients %>%
  ggplot(aes(total)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Number of Service Encounters") +
    ylab("Number of Neighbors") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(median(proj1_clients$total)), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
    annotate(geom = "text", x=20, y=5000, label = "Median = 2", color="red") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Service Encounters")

ggsave(filename = "fig_sup1_service_histo.png")

proj1_clients %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(year_started), y=total)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  xlab("Year of First Service Encounter") +
  ylab("Number of Service Encounters") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Service Encounters by Year")

ggsave(filename = "fig_sup2_service_box.png")

proj1_clients %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(year_started), y=as.numeric(time_served))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year of First Service Encounter") +
  ylab("Days between First and Last Encounter") +
  ggtitle("Time since First and Last Encounter")

ggsave(filename = "fig_sup3_time_box.png")

proj1_clients_year %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=`Client File Number`)) +
    geom_tile() +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Neighbor ID") +
    ggtitle("Number of Encounters per Year per Neighbor")

ggsave(filename = "fig_sup4_encounter_tile.png")
```

## Food Distribution

The amount of food delivered has increased over the years. There does not seem to be a clear visual signal of seasonal change.

```{r plot_food, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=food_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="Food\nDistributed (lbs)", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Food Distributed (lbs)")
```

## Clothing Distribution

The amount of clothing delivered has changed over time. The peak year was 2014.

```{r plot_cloth, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=cloth_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="Clothing\nDistributed", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Clothing Distributed")
```

## School Kit Distribution

The quality of data on school kit distribution may be poor.

```{r plot_school, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=school_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="School Kits\nDistributed", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of School Kits Distributed")
```

## Hygiene Kit Distribution

We know that hygiene kits are still being distributed, but the data capture on these events are poor. It appears that there have been almost no hygiene kits distributed since 2014, which we know to be false.

```{r plot_hygiene, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=hygiene_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="Hygiene Kits\nDistributed", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Hygiene Kits Distributed")
```

## Diaper Distribution

The quality of data on diaper distribution may be poor. There may be higher diaper distribution in the summer.

```{r plot_dipaer, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
proj1_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill=diaper_total)) +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", breaks = unique(proj1_date$month)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", name="Diapers\nDistributed", direction = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Calendar Month") +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Diapers Distributed")
```

# Conclusion

The best data on changes over time in this UMD provided dataset are for food distribution. Food distribution has increased over time and does not seem to have strong seasonal variation.
