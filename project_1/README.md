This repo contains files for Project 1 in the Fall 2019 BIOS 611 course at UNC Chapel Hill.

The data for this project comes from the [Urban Ministries of Durham](http://www.umdurham.org/).

The objective of this project is to perform "[a] "complete" analysis in R, demonstrating data wrangling, modeling, visualization and delivery using R markdown."

The goal of this project is to study the services provided by the Urban Ministries of Durham to aid with future resource allocation. Part of this includes cleaning and wrangling the raw data collected by the Urban Ministries over the past two decades.
