# Background: Urban Ministries of Durham
![alt text](http://www.umdurham.org/assets/images/logo-new1.png "Urban Ministries Logo")
The Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) fights poverty and homeless by offering food, shelter, and a future to neighbors in need. During the 2017-2018 fiscal year, UMD provided 54,378 nights of shelter to homeless neighbors (792 unique individuals), served 248,028 meals through the community cafe, and provided clothing and groceries to over 500 households per month. They ended homelessness for 243 individuals.

The three primary arms of UMD are the community shelter, community cafe, and food pantry/clothing closet. UMD is also engaged in community outreach and enrichment. About 80% of UMD's contributions (excluding in-kind donations) come from gifts and grants from foundations, the government, and communities of faith.

# Research Question
1) How have UMD's core services changed over time? This will focus on the distribution of food, bus tickets, school kits, hygiene kits, and financial support.
2) How do these trends fit into the context of City of Durham Community Indicators? The focus here will be median gross monthly rent, median housing value, and unemployment rates.

# Approach

For the first part, we will use data provided by UMD and plot trends over calendar time. Given the need for UMD to present data for annual reports, we will also provide numbers using a fiscal calendar.

For the second part, we will use data from Durham's Open Data [portal](https://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/community-indicators). Data from the Community Indicators trends will be compared to trends in UMD services.
