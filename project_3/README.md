# Background
The Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) fights poverty and homeless by offering food, shelter, and a future to neighbors in need. During the 2017-2018 fiscal year, UMD provided 54,378 nights of shelter to homeless neighbors (792 unique individuals), served 248,028 meals through the community cafe, and provided clothing and groceries to over 500 households per month. They ended homelessness for 243 individuals.

The three primary arms of UMD are the community shelter, community cafe, and food pantry/clothing closet. UMD is also engaged in community outreach and enrichment. About 80% of UMD's contributions (excludign in-kind donations) come from gifts and grants from foundations, the government, and communities of faith.
