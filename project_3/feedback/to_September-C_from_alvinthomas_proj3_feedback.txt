To September-C:

Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate the time you spent reviewing my work.
As you note, most of the technical features of my project were implemented, but
have I made improvements to the use of Docker and Make in my project environment.
I have also improved the take-aways and interpretation based on other feedback.

Points	Description

6/6	Feedback was “meta” – the feedback went beyond finding typos to helping you with higher-level improvements
2/2	Feedback was respectful and optimistic – you feel helped and encouraged after reading the feedback

Score: 13/15
