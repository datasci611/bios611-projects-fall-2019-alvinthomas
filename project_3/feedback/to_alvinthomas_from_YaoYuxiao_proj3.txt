
Hi Alvin,


Overall, your project3 draft has a good format and logic!



-------------Review of README-------------


The background is very clear to me.

Datasets used in the project are detailed.

Objectives are clear and interesting, they make sense from the client’s point of view. 

Progress for the project provide a good outline.


-------------Review of Makefile and Dockerfile----------------

Docker is used to define execution environments appropriately.

You may add more to Makefile later to manage the workflow of the project.

-------------Review of Python and R scripts----------------


The project uses both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts well.

Your codes are neat and readable!


-------------Review of html report---------------------


Various kinds of plots do a good job of analyzing and summarizing.

The interpretation of figures is clearly explained.

However, adding some explaination could be a good idea to help clients understand underlying meaning of the plot.

Also, you may want to add more transistion paragraphs to show connections between questions.

It seems that you are focusing on demographics of clients, which is definitely useful to the UMD.

However, some other aspects such as correlations and staying trends might be interesting too.



-------------Review of codes--------------------



Your codes are neat and readable!




Good luck in final project!
